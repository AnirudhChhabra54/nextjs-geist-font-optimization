## 📦 Folder Structure

```
project-root/
│
├── frontend/           # React application
├── backend/            # Node.js Express server
├── data/               # Destination pricing data
├── README.md           # This file
└── .env                # API keys and secrets (optional)
```

## 📌 How It Works

* Backend loads location-wise pricing data for transport, hotel, and food.
* Calculates cost:
  `Total = Travel + (Hotel x Days) + (Food x Days)`
* If total > budget → downgrades options & suggests a better fit.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Real API integration (Skyscanner, Booking.com)
* User authentication & saved trips
* Maps and hotel previews
* Multi-currency support
